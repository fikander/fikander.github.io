Drone videos from out trip to South East Asia.

In December 2014 we took a wonderful trip to south east Asia, which included Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.

Alongside my trusty **Nikon D7000** I also took **DJI Phantom 2** and **GoPro Hero 3 Black** with me, which resulted in some crazy flights.  
Some of the locations where we flew:

- center of Bangkok - just above [The Grand Palace](http://www.bangkok.com/attraction-palace/grand-palace.htm)
- Mui Ne area in Vietnam
- and of course - Angkor Temples in Cambodia

The videos were edited and published during our journey. I used **Final Cut Pro X** on a 13" Mac Book Pro for editing.

One video got particular recognition and parts of it (few seconds really) were featured in several places, including **vox.com**. One of **GoPro** professional editors wanted to use it in GoPro showcase video, but resolution of 1080p @ 30fps of my raw material was not enough for their workflow (the minimum they'd accept is 2.7k).

Anyway, here's the most successful video:

And here's the playlist with other videos published so far:
